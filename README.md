# About Me!
Hello! My name is Kira. I have a bachelor's degree in software engineering and my passion is for web development.

I work on maintaining a website I created for a guitar teacher with the MEAN stack called [EstudioGuitar](estudioguitar.com)

You may see a lot of empty space where I didn't make any commits from Jan 2022-June 2023. This was because I was volunteering
full time as a missionary for my church in Iowa. Yes the land of the corn fields 🌽 I loved serving there and talking to all
sorts of different people including people from Tanzania and the Congo.

I made a website about myself [here](https://kirapeters.github.io/) a couple years ago and am currently in the process to make it
a little more ✨ spectacular ✨

When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me practicing piano 🎹, playing TOTK 👾, or painting 🎨.
Feel free to reach out to me through Instagram @kirachereep
